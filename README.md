*A digital studio for analog dreams*

## 🎨 Studio Manifesto

This is a living archive of my art process—raw, real, and ever-evolving.
It's not a portfolio. It's not a gallery. It's a **workspace**.
A place where pigment meets pixels, where ideas dry slow, and where experiments matter more than perfection.

Here, I track:

* Paint behavior across brands, mediums, and conditions (humidity, lighting, brush types, etc.)
* Underpaintings, color studies, and in-progress works
* Daily doodles, gestures, and intuitive messes
* Technical notes, material reactions, mood logs
* Reference material I return to again and again

The goal?
To understand my tools, document my discoveries, and build a rhythm between intuition and iteration.

This is where I work it out.
Where mistakes are mentors and mess is welcome.
Where I study myself as much as the medium.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure (so far)

```
/experiments/     # Paint studies and controlled tests
/sketchbook/      # Casual scribbles, gesture warm-ups
/underpaintings/  # Foundation layers and composition planning
/logs/            # Written reflections, observations, conditions
/references/      # Color theory, texture inspiration, value charts
```

Here we can keep tweaking the tone, adding personal touches, renaming things as we rebuild them, and even swipe out one daydream for a dream come true. Workshop it till it *feels* like your space.
